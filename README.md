# Meet

## Project Description 

Meet is a progressive web application developed for my portfolio during Achievement 4 of the CareerFoundry course. It was built using a test driven development approach. Meet uses Google Calendar API data to find information about events in a given area.

## Try it out

This app is currently awaiting proper google verification. Until this is achieved, there are two ways to access the app.

If you would like to see the live version of the app, linked to the Google Calendar API, you can do so [here.](https://benschwartz96.github.io/meet/) Given that it is not yet properly verified, you would need to choose a Google account, click 'advanced' in the bottom left when it tells you the app has not been verified, and choose to continue anyway. 

If you would prefer to see a locally hosted version of the app (using only sample data), the easiest way is to clone the repository using the steps below in your terminal.

- `git clone https://github.com/BenSchwartz96/meet.git`
- `cd meet`
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

## Technologies used

The main technologies, languages, and libraries used in the development of this app include:

 - Javascript
 - React
 - Recharts
 - AWS
 - Google Calendar API

# **Features**

### **FEATURE 1: FILTER EVENTS BY CITY**

- **SCENARIO 1: WHEN USER HASN’T SEARCHED FOR A CITY, SHOW UPCOMING EVENTS FROM ALL CITIES**

  - `Given` user hasn’t searched for any city
  - `When` the user opens the app
  - `Then` the user should see a list of all upcoming events

- **SCENARIO 2: USER SHOULD SEE A LIST OF SUGGESTIONS WHEN THEY SEARCH FOR A CITY**

  - `Given` the main page is open
  - `When` user starts typing in the city textbox
  - `Then` the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed

- **SCENARIO 3: USER CAN SELECT A CITY FROM THE SUGGESTED LIST**

  - `Given` the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox
  - `And` the list of suggested cities is showing
  - `When` the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list
  - `Then` their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”)
  - `And` the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city

  ***

### **FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS**

- **SCENARIO 1: AN EVENT ELEMENT IS COLLAPSED BY DEFAULT**

  - `Given` app is first loaded
  - `When` events list is rendered
  - `Then` each event in the list is collapsed by default

- **SCENARIO 2: USER CAN EXPAND AN EVENT TO SEE ITS DETAILS**

  - `Given` event is rendered
  - `When` user clicks on the event
  - `Then` event details are shown

- **SCENARIO 3: USER CAN COLLAPSE AN EVENT TO HIDE ITS DETAILS**

  - `Given` event is rendered
  - `And` event details are shown
  - `When` user clicks on the event
  - `Then` event details are hidden

  ***

### **FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS**

- **Scenario 1: WHEN USER HASN'T SPECIFIED A NUMBER, 32 IS THE DEFAULT NUMBER**

  - `Given` the user boots up the app
  - `When` events list is displayed
  - `Then` the app will display 32 events by default

- **Scenario 2: USER CAN CHANGE THE NUMBER OF EVENTS THEY WANT TO SEE**

  - `Given` the events list is rendered
  - `When` the user changes the 'number of events' input field
  - `Then` the number of events rendered in the event list will change accordingly

  ***

### **FEATURE 4: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE**

- **Scenario 1: SHOW CACHED DATA WHEN THERE'S NO INTERNET CONNECTION**

  - `Given` the user has no internet connection
  - `When` they load the app
  - `Then` a cached version of the last page they were on is displayed

- **Scenario 2: SHOW ERROR WHEN THE USER CHANGES THE SETTINGS**

  - `Given` the user has no internet connection
  - `When` they try to load something new (new event, city, etc)
  - `Then` an error will be displayed

  ***

### **FEATURE 5: DATA VISUALISATION**

- **Scenario 1: SHOW A CHART WITH THE NUMBER OF UPCOMING EVENTS IN EACH CITY**

  - `Given` the user is on the main page of the app
  - `When` the event list is rendered
  - `Then` a chart visualising the number of upcoming events in each city will be displayed
